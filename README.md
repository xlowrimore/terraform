# Terraforming Jenkins
This project will launch a single server t2.micro EC2 instance, update it's kernal, install java, install and start Jenkins.

# Note: This terraform project is intended for prexisting security groups and uses it's own Keypair.
You will need to replace the key_name (AWS key, not public key) and security_groups with your own.
